1. How many levels of caches does your CPU have (L1, L2, L3, etc.)? 
Is there separate L1 cache for data and instructions? 

	There are 3 levels of caches: L1, L2, and L3. L1 has separate caches 
	for Instructions and data. 
	
2. How big is each level of cache? 
L1 D-Cache = 128 KBytes
L1 I-Cache = 128 KBytes
L2 Cache = 1024 KBytes
L3 Cache = 6 MBytes

3. What is the block size (sometimes it is called line size)? 
L1 D-Cache = 64 bytes
L1 I-Cache = 64 bytes
L2 Cache = 64 bytes
L3 Cache = 64 bytes
	
4. Are the caches direct-mapped or set associative? 
If set associative, how many ways? 
	
All are set associative.
	
L1 D-Cache = 8 way
L1 I-Cache = 8 way
L2 Cache = 4 way
L3 Cache = 12 way
	
5. With L1 data cache, how many tag bits, index bits, and offset bits? 
	
index = log base 2 (set) = log base 2 ((1024 * 128)/64*8) = 8
	
	1024B * 128KB = 131072 B
	8 = associativity  
	64B = block size
	
	offset = log base 2 (64) = 6
	
	64B = block size 
	
	tag = 64 - 8 - 6 = 50
